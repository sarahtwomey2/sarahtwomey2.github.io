<!--<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p>My artistic intention aims to connect the viewer not only to themselves but to the broader network around them, thus creating a space to discuss topics of political environmental issues, subjects of taboos, and the navigation through one’s own mixed identity. My work emphasizes the importance of materials to question the viewer’s relationship to their surroundings. By utilizing mixed media such as eggshells, clay, menstrual blood, or glass, I seek to further push a dialog of how we can consciously shape the relationship we have with our environment and ourselves. My artwork investigates the individual's role in a community and their agency to advocate and initiate change in their environment. </p>
<p>I draw inspiration from artists such as Ana Mendieta and Neha Kudchadkar to inform my artistic research. Both artists use methods such as performative body work and sculpture to address our relationship with the earth, our society, and our own perception.</p>
<p>My work not only gravitates towards the use of abstracted and figurative forms to create a space for the viewer to reflect and question their physical and social surroundings, but through use of specific mixed mediums I aim to encourage discourse about accepted perceptions surrounding  subjects of taboos, political issues, and the navigation through identities we have within ourself and our community.
