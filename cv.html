<h1>About</h1>
<p>My artistic identity centers around the idea of environmental awareness, exploration of materials, displacement/isolation, community and an investigation into organic material and ideas of permanence (a strife).</p>
<p>Moving to Los Angeles alone left me in a place of displacement and isolation. From there I began questioning the impact of environment on individuals and the communities they exist within. My artistic identity aims to connect the viewer not only to themselves to but the broader network around them. Glass as a medium became an important facilitator to express these concepts. </p>
<p>This emphasis on building a knowledge sharing community and working less as an individual  pushed me to think interdisciplinary and approach art work differently.</p>
<p>This emphasis on building a knowledge sharing community and working less as an individual  pushed me to think interdisciplinary and changed how I create and approach artwork.</p>
